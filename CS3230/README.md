# CS3230 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Taken in 2019/2020 Semester 2, under Prof Ken Sung and Prof Diptarka CHAKRABORTY

# Review

This module is very hard. It requires a strong background in mathematics to be able to solve.
You will be taught common problem solving techniques, such as Dynamic Programming, Greedy.
But it is not enough to be able to come up with the solution, what is more important in this module is to be able to prove that your solution is correct, which is very difficult.
The problems just seem to be more challenging than the last.

Lectures were very enjoyable, Prof Ken had a great way of explaining things during live lectures, he was always full of energy.
However due to the COvid-19 outbreak, where everything moved online, i didn't feel the energy that he had during live lectures.
Test was open book, but i don't think it really helped.
