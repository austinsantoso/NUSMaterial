# NUSMaterial
There are the reference sheets which I made to survive NUS.
These files are not necessarily cheat sheets, rather summaries.

I usually squeeze the pages together to make the cheat sheet(to a reasonable extent XD) or take what I feel necessary.

Feel free to use them, or adjust to your needs.
